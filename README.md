# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
# **Python之禅 ，by Tim Peters**

Beautiful is better than ugly.

**优美好于丑陋（Python 以优美的代码为其风格，不要写丑陋的代码）**


Explicit is better than implicit.

**明了好于隐晦（Python的每一行代码、每一个变量、每一函数的意义应该是明确的，让人看了一目了然）**


Simple is better than complex.

**简洁好于复杂（Python的每一行代码应当是简洁的，一行代码只为一个子功能）*


Complex is better than complicated.

**复杂好于凌乱（如果无法避免引入复杂的代码，也要尽量保证代码之间明确简洁的关系）**


Flat is better than nested.

**扁平好于嵌套（Python的代码结构应该是扁平的，不应该有太多嵌套的结构）**


Sparse is better than dense.

**稀疏好于密集（Python代码之间应该是有间隔的，每个功能块、每个函数、每个参数、每个类之间应当有适当的间距）**


Readability counts.

**代码可读性很重要（Python代码具有很好的可读性，注释、变量名、函数名、类名、模块名、代码块功能等的作用和意义都是一目了然的）**


Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.

**虽然实用性很重要，但任何特殊情况都不足以特殊到违背上述规则
（不要为了处理某一个特殊情况，而破坏了上述任何一个规则）**


Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.

**不要忽视任何错误，除非有意为之（任何时候都要对异常和错误进行处理，不要写 except:pass 风格的代码）**


In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

**面对模棱两可的情况，拒绝享受让别人去猜测的乐趣 提供有且仅有的一种最明显解决方法
（解决一个问题的方法可能会有很多种，但在Python中，只选择最明显的那一个）**


Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

**虽然起初这很难做到，除非你是荷兰人（荷兰人暗指 Python之父：Guido van Rossum（龟叔） ）**


Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.

**动手行动好于什么都不做，但不加思考就行动还不如不做**


If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

**如果某问题一个代码实现很难解释，那说明这个实现不是很好**


If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

**如果某问题一个代码实现很简单，那这个实现可能走在正确的路上**


Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

**命名空间是一个很棒的注意，应当多加利用**


Hello World!

**你好，世界！**
